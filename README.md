# Pacman AI Projects (UC Berkeley)

This repository contains my implementations for the UC Berkeley [Pacman AI Projects](http://ai.berkeley.edu/).  
The projects explore fundamental concepts in Artificial Intelligence, including search algorithms, multi-agent systems, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning.

## Contents
- `search.py` – search algorithms (DFS, BFS, UCS, A*)
- `searchAgents.py` – agents using different search strategies
- `multiAgents.py` – adversarial search (Minimax, Alpha-Beta, Expectimax)
- `valueIterationAgents.py` – value iteration for MDPs
- `qlearningAgents.py` – reinforcement learning with Q-learning
- `bustersAgents.py` & `inference.py` – probabilistic inference and ghost tracking
- `analysis.py` – written analysis and algorithm discussion

## Attribution
These projects were originally developed at UC Berkeley. The skeleton code and autograders were created by John DeNero and Dan Klein.  

I implemented the algorithms and agents as part of my coursework.  
This repository contains **my own solutions** only, not official Berkeley solutions.
